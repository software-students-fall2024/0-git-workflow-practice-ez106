# Interesting Software Development Article:
[Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering â€” A Real Threat for Developers?](https://introduct.tech/blog/artificial-intelligence-a-threat-for-software-engineers/)

I found this article to be very interesting because I have been wondering how the increased use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will affect how software engineers do things and the job market. Researchers at Oak Ridge National laboratory said "that AI could replace human developers by 2040". The article discusses the pros and cons of artificial intelligence such as increased productivity and privacy concerns. It gives suggestions to those who are worried about their jobs being taken
1. Understanding machine learning
2. Strengthening programming skills
3. Knowing how to handle large data sets
4. Learning about ethical AI 
5. Learn text preprocessing
6. Familiarize Data Science Concepts

This list of suggestions is very helpfu for me, giving me guidance on what to learn going forward. However, even though Artificial Intelligence will change the software engineering industry, software engineers are still going to be in high demand because software engineering will still require ethics and human judgment.

I also found this article to be interesting because of how AI is a hot topic in the tech industry. Personally, I think that AI is still far from being able to completely replace humans at their jobs, but AI will inevitably become a day to day tool that is commonly used while working as assistance. The most improtant for us is to learn how to responsibly use the AI tools and detect when it is wrong/going the wrong direction, and the way for us to do that is to first become knowledgable ourselves without the use of any AI.
